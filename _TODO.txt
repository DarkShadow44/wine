__ptr32 patch:
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D66827
- https://reviews.llvm.org/p/akhuang/
- https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42359


make_thunks tasks:
- support bitfields
- write tests for everything covered (struct/union parsing)
- commandline option to limit to one dll (for testing)
- commandline to run tests
- commandline to fixup sources
- fixup sources (only change structs that can be passed over API) (Add __ptr32 to pointers and function pointers) (find all long (and definition), need to fix those too)
- refactor
- convert to clean C
- cleanu
- document, comment
- multithreading
- commandline for multithreading
- Support cdecl
- Support functions with more than 4 parameters
- Support thiscall
- Support interfaces (fixup vtbl)
- Returned function pointer in parameter, or in struct in parameter
- check if 32bit structure is same as 64bit (alignment)


Wine pure tasks:
- stack not too high?
- must compile wine-pure programs (e.g. regedit.exe) as 32bit?
- mixed mode needs to work!
- GDT on Mac
- Get kernel32_test to work
- detect if function pointer is thunk
- callbacks
- find void ** (might be interface)
- updating GDT data enough? or need LGDT?
- where to make the cut? and why?
- MacOS catalina selectors, need to be dynamic not hardcoded in wine-pure code
- Linux/Mac dump GDT (SGDT) - GDT is per CPU ?!



Could be useful:
- diff hangover wine against vanilla
- diff qemu against vanilla


32bit dlls		->								thunk							-> cocreateobject (64bit)	->			thunk		-> GetDllObject (32bit)
function(32bit)	<- remove 64->32 converter thunk / add 32->64 converter thunk	<- function(64bit)			<- add converter thunk  <- function(32bit)
